# UnitySnakeGame
Classic Snake game made in Unity using C# with custom built neural network and Matrix Libraries in C#

## To get the game
  Make sure you have unity installed and import this project (or copy the files over to your own project named Snake)

  ### To use Neural Network for Snake
    Make sure that the `playMode` variable is set to false in Snake.cs
  
    Make sure the `population` is equal to the amount of snakes you want per generation in PopulationManager.cs
  
  ### To play the Snake Game like normal
    Make sure that the `playMode` variable is set to true in Snake.cs
  
    Make sure the `population` is equal to 1 in PopulationManager.cs
  
If you would like to look at a mini demo of how the gameplay works, and see the snakes learn a little. Watch the video below

Most of the code yet hasn't been commented and I will try to get that done as soon as I get time
